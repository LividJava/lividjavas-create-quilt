# LividJava's Create Re-Stitched
LividJava's Create Re-Stitched now featuring **The Quilt Mod Loader!** Using the same ideas as the Forge version.

## Explore the world!
Jam packed full of various biome and structure mods there will always be something to find just around the next bend! Featuring the BetterX suite and YUNG's mods you'll always find something interesting!

## Travel in **STYLE**
With Create's Full Steam update adding in trains, *the very center of this pack*,  build your own Transit lines, Stations and Engines! Get around in **STYLE!**

## Why this pack exists.
When Mojang added Elytra, it really changed and arguably ruined the game for me. I noticed I explored less and was generally having less fun playing the game. So I wanted to create an experience that focused on Exploration and Getting around!

You won't find Elytra in this modpack they've been removed from structures. I've removed them to help focus on the idea of transit around the world through your own creativity! With no teleportation you'll have to get around the ol' fashioned way, on foot!

Also, another major notable change is the removal of Ice Boats in the Nether. Because Create trains can enter the Nether I wanted to encourage you to focus on finding interesting ways of getting around!

### Who is this for?
This pack is made for the player who wants to slow down and explore. Who felt that flying around the world, rushing for the End ruined the modpack experience. Take it slow, enjoy the world around you, focus on the little things!
